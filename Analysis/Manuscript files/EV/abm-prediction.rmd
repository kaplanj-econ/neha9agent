ABM EV PREDICTION MODEL

Filtering out a lot of noise in calibratenotebook to get only the essentials and manuscript figures/tables

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(betareg)
```

We use the varfit specification done forever ago
```{r}
load("C:/dev/EconABM/Analysis/ev/varData.Rdata")
```
Use the predone summary, local computers can't calculate these residuals
```{r}
varFit_s
```
