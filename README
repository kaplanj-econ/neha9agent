#LIBRARIES
To use this model, please download boost and cereal and place them in the headers folder as "boost" and "cereal"

Boost: https://www.boost.org/users/download/
Cereal: https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/index.html

The file structure should look like the following:

headers
  -> boost
    -> accumulators
    -> algorithms
    -> etc...
  -> cereal
    -> archives
    -> details
    -> etc...
    
Once these folders are in place, the model can be run with "make", producing an executable called "serial.out". To run the model use the following:

<executable-name> <path/to/econConfig> <path/to/bioConfig>

If no config parameters are provided, the defaults located at configs/econConfig.json and configs/bioConfigs.json will be used.
